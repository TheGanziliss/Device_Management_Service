# Objective

This project provides a database connection for device management, allowing CRUD operations to be performed on the database. This enables you to store information about devices and display their properties using the information in the database.

In addition, this project enables tracking of device subscription to topics on a broker using the MQTT protocol, for devices that are added to the database. This is an essential feature for real-time monitoring of device status and data.

The MQTT protocol enables connected devices to interact with each other and with users over the internet, facilitating communication between devices. By using the MQTT protocol in your projects, you can optimize device interaction and simplify communication between devices and users.

In summary, this project provides a useful tool for device management and control, by combining a database and the MQTT protocol. You can monitor and modify device status and data, and optimize device performance.
